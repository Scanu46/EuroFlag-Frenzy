This is my PP2. It is a website with a quiz on european countries. There are different difficulties for the quiz ranging from easy to master. When a question is answered correctly, the button will go green. If answered incorrectly, the button will go red.

## Media Queries
Media queries were used to scale the website from a width of 320px and up.
